## slides for CMPS2200: Introduction to Algorithms

[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/tulane-cmps2200/slides/master)

All slides are listed below. There are three ways to view:

1. [Binder](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/tulane-cmps2200/slides/master) (**preferred**): runs the Jupyter notebooks in the cloud so you can interact with the notes directly.
2. [NBViewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/tulane-cmps2200/slides/tree/master/): static versions, mostly rendered correctly.
3. Clone this repo and launch the notebooks locally by running `jupyter notebook` (requires installing  [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) and [RISE](https://rise.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html)).
